# Super Smash Bros -- Ulticlick
## a jQuery Click Game

I'm somewhat happy with how this turned out. I once again had a couple of features that I wanted to implement but lost the time and patience to do so, and I don't necessarily thing it turned out as well as my previous game, but it's functional. I chose to forego the counterattack and raised attack missives of the bonus game - perhaps to the detriment of my grade - because I felt it made it too easy to have a single path to victory. Instead I wanted there to be an even chance to win or lose, so that everyone was on the same level. What fun is a game that you can constantly win?

Future functionality I hope to someday implement:
* Improved UI
* Audio
* A secret Smash button for ultimate moves.
* More flavor text!
